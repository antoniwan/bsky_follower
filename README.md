# Bluesky Follower

A Go program to help manage following users on Bluesky social network.

## Features

- Login to Bluesky using your credentials
- Follow users from a database
- Filter users by minimum follower count
- Simulation mode to preview actions
- Track already followed users
- Update follower counts automatically
- Fetch and save top users from Bluesky directory
- Enhanced logging with debug mode
- SQLite database for reliable data storage
- Proper DID (Decentralized Identifier) handling
- Rate limiting and error handling

## Requirements

- Go 1.16 or later
- Bluesky account credentials

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```bash
# BlueSky API Configuration
BSKY_IDENTIFIER=your.bsky.social
BSKY_PASSWORD=your_app_password

# Application Settings
DEBUG_MODE=false
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30s

# Database Configuration
DB_PATH=users.db

# Fallback Handles (comma-separated list of handles to use if directory fetch fails)
FALLBACK_HANDLES=handle1.bsky.social,handle2.bsky.social

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY=1s
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
go mod download
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Usage

The application supports the following command-line flags:

- `-simulate`: Run in simulation mode (no actual follows)
- `-update-top`: Fetch top users from bsky.directory and save to database
- `-min-followers`: Minimum followers required to follow (default: 0)
- `-real`: Actually follow users (default is simulation only)

### Examples

1. Fetch and save top users:

```bash
go run main.go --update-top
```

2. Follow users with minimum followers:

```bash
go run main.go --min-followers 1000 --real
```

3. Simulate following users:

```bash
go run main.go --simulate
```

## Data Storage

The application uses SQLite for data storage. All user data is stored in `users.db` with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    handle TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    did TEXT,
    followers INTEGER,
    saved_on TEXT,
    followed BOOLEAN
)
```

Fields:

- `handle`: The user's Bluesky handle (e.g., "username.bsky.social")
- `did`: The user's Decentralized Identifier (DID)
- `followers`: Number of followers
- `saved_on`: Timestamp when the user was added
- `followed`: Whether the user has been followed

## Logging

The application provides detailed logging with multiple levels:

- `TRACE`: Most detailed logging (only in debug mode)
- `DEBUG`: Detailed logging (only in debug mode)
- `INFO`: General information
- `WARN`: Warning messages
- `ERROR`: Error messages
- `AUDIT`: Important state changes

To enable debug mode, set `DEBUG_MODE=true` in your environment variables.

## Environment Variables

- `BSKY_IDENTIFIER`: Your Bluesky handle or email
- `BSKY_PASSWORD`: Your Bluesky app password
- `BSKY_FALLBACK_HANDLES`: Comma-separated list of fallback handles (optional)
- `BSKY_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (optional, default: 10)
- `DEBUG_MODE`: Enable detailed logging (optional, default: false)

## Notes

- The program will skip users you're already following
- Follower counts are automatically updated if not provided
- A 3-second delay is added between operations to avoid rate limiting
- The program tracks followed users in both memory and database
- SQLite database provides reliable data storage and atomic updates
- Proper DID handling ensures successful follows
- Error handling for common Bluesky API issues

## Version History

### v1.0.0 (2024-04-30)

## üåê Auth Notes

Bluesky uses **App Passwords**, which you can generate [here](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords). You do **not** need API keys or tokens.

The script logs in using your handle/email and app password and fetches your DID + JWT token securely.

## üìà Planned Features

- Better error handling + logging
- Dynamic trending user fetch
- Export/import database functionality
- Backup and restore functionality
- Batch processing for large user lists
- Customizable rate limiting

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your app password secure
- The application uses SQLite for data storage - ensure proper file permissions
- Debug mode should be disabled in production
